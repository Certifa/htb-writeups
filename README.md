# üß† HTB Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups for Hack The Box machines.  
Each folder includes:

- Summary of the approach
- Nmap output
- Key steps (initial access ‚Üí privilege escalation)
- Reflections on what I learned

‚ö†Ô∏è These writeups are for **educational purposes only**. Boxes were solved in a legal environment (HTB labs with user access).
